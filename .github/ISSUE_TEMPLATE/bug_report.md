## Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Expected Behavior:**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen based on the tutorial documentation.

For the '/hello' endpoint specifically:
- Expected Response: `Hello world`
- Expected Status Code: `200 OK`
- Expected Content-Type: `text/plain`
- Expected Server Startup: Server should start and listen on port 3000

**Actual Behavior:**
A clear and concise description of what actually happened.

**Error Messages:**
```
# Paste any error messages, stack traces, or unexpected output here
# Include both console output and any browser error messages
```

**Screenshots/Output:** (if applicable)
<!-- Add screenshots of error messages, browser output, or terminal output -->

**Logs:** (if available)
```
# Include relevant log output from the application
# Check for any log files or additional debug output
```

## Component Analysis

**Affected Components:** (Check all that seem relevant)
- [ ] üåê HTTP Server (`src/backend/lib/server/http-server.js`)
- [ ] üîÄ Request Router (`src/backend/lib/router/request-router.js`)
- [ ] üëã Hello Handler (`src/backend/lib/handlers/hello-handler.js`)
- [ ] üì§ Response Generator (`src/backend/lib/response/response-generator.js`)
- [ ] ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (`src/backend/lib/config/`)
- [ ] üõ†Ô∏è Utilities (`src/backend/lib/utils/`)
- [ ] üîß Middleware (`src/backend/lib/middleware/`)
- [ ] üìù Scripts (`src/backend/scripts/`)
- [ ] üì¶ Package Configuration (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`)
- [ ] üîß Development Tools (nodemon, ESLint, Jest)
- [ ] üóÉÔ∏è Other: _______________

**Error Location Analysis:**
- Where did the error first appear? (Browser, Terminal, Specific file)
- Does the error happen during startup, request processing, or response generation?
- Are there any related warnings or messages in other components?

**Network Analysis:** (for HTTP-related issues)
- Can you access http://localhost:3000 in browser?
- What happens when you visit http://localhost:3000/hello?
- Does `curl http://localhost:3000/hello` work from command line?
- Is the port 3000 available? (Check with `netstat` or `lsof`)

## Troubleshooting Attempted

**Troubleshooting Steps Tried:** (Check all that apply)
- [ ] Restarted the application (`Ctrl+C` then `npm start`)
- [ ] Reinstalled dependencies (`rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`)
- [ ] Tried different Node.js version
- [ ] Checked if port 3000 is available (`netstat -an | grep 3000`)
- [ ] Tested with fresh clone of repository
- [ ] Cleared npm cache (`npm cache clean --force`)
- [ ] Checked for antivirus/firewall interference
