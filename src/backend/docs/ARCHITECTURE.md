### 2.3 System Boundaries

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "System Boundary"
        A[HTTP Client] --> B[Node.js HTTP Server]
        B --> C[Request Router]
        C --> D[Hello Handler]
        D --> E[Response Generator]
        E --> B
        B --> A
    end
    
    subgraph "External Dependencies"
        F[Node.js Runtime]
        G[Operating System]
        H[Network Stack]
    end
    
    B -.-> F
    F -.-> G
    G -.-> H
```

- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js v18+ with built-in modules only
- **Operating System**: Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Educational Scope**: Single endpoint demonstrating core concepts

## 3. Architectural Principles

### 3.1 Educational Clarity First

The architecture prioritizes learning value and comprehension over production complexity:

```javascript
// Example: Educational error messages with guidance
const educationalGuidance = {
    issue: `The requested path '${requestedPath}' is not available on this server`,
    validEndpoints: VALID_ENDPOINTS,
    troubleshootingSteps: [
        'Verify the URL spelling and case sensitivity',
        'Ensure the path starts with a forward slash (/)',
        'Check that you are accessing a configured endpoint'
    ],
    httpConcept: '404 Not Found indicates the requested resource does not exist'
};
```

### 3.2 Event-Driven Processing

The architecture leverages Node.js's event-driven model for non-blocking request handling:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server
    participant Router
    participant Handler
    
    Client->>Server: HTTP Request
    Server->>Router: Route Analysis
    Router->>Handler: Process Request
    Handler->>Router: Generate Response
    Router->>Server: Complete Response
    Server->>Client: HTTP Response
```

### 3.3 Stateless Design

Each HTTP request is processed independently without persistent state:

- No session management or persistent connections
- No shared state between requests
- Automatic garbage collection and memory management
- Simple restart and recovery procedures

### 3.4 Separation of Concerns

Clear component boundaries with single responsibility principle:

| Component | Responsibility | Dependencies |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| server.js | Application bootstrapping and lifecycle | http-server.js, app-config.js, logger.js |
| http-server.js | HTTP server creation and management | request-router.js, server-config.js |
| request-router.js | URL analysis and request routing | hello-handler.js, response-generator.js |
| hello-handler.js | Business logic for /hello endpoint | response-generator.js, validators.js |
| response-generator.js | HTTP response construction | http-status-codes.js, response-messages.js |

### 3.5 Educational Security

Localhost-only deployment ensures safe learning environment:

- Network binding restricted to 127.0.0.1
- No external network exposure
- Safe for classroom and personal learning
- Educational error messages without sensitive information disclosure

```

### 4.2 Request Processing Flow

The system processes HTTP requests through a linear pipeline with comprehensive educational monitoring:

1. **Request Arrival**: HTTP client sends request to localhost:3000
2. **Server Reception**: Node.js HTTP server receives and creates request/response objects
3. **Router Analysis**: Request router parses URL and validates HTTP method
4. **Route Matching**: Router matches request path against configured endpoints
5. **Handler Delegation**: Matched requests forwarded to appropriate handler
6. **Response Generation**: Handler processes request and generates HTTP response
7. **Response Transmission**: Complete response sent back to client
8. **Educational Logging**: Comprehensive logging throughout the entire process
